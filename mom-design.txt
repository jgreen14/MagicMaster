MOM Remake Notes
-----------------

-1st goal is to stay as faithful to the design of MOM as possible with
improvements to UI and AI as the only significant changes


Parts of MOM (essentially a list of base classes):

1) Players
	-Includes human and AI players
	-Needs to contain all cities, spells, units and other attributes
	like gold, mana, fame, spellbooks, controlled nodes, etc...

	a) Global AI
		-Evaluates an AI player's current global situation and decides on
		what actions to take
		-Some memory for each AI to track past moves and relationships
		-Individual AI wizard personalities
	b) Tactical AI
		-Evaluates an AI player's tactical situation and takes action

2) Units
	-Must contain all the attributes shared by units (HP, mana, movement,
	defense, attack, spells, special abilities, name, description, etc...)


3) Cities
	-Includes all the buildings, population, production levels, unit
	production, enchantments, state of unrest, units occupying city,
	etc...

4) World
	-Includes all the Players, cities, non-Player units, nodes,
	"goodie huts", world map, global enchantments, global events, etc...

5) Renderer
	-Outputs the relevant data from the previous parts to the current screen
	-List of screens:
		01) World Map
		02) Tactical Map
		03) City
		04) Spellbook
		05) Diplomacy
		06) Magic
		07) Armies/Heroes

6) I/O
	-Takes input from human player and sends appropriate data to renderer
	-Saves/loads current state of game to/from disk 


How to procede:
-Create human player class with unit and city lists and basic attributes
-Create basic unit class and a couple melee units
-Create City class with building list, population, production levels and
units in city list
-Create world class with basic map, player list and city list
-Create Renderer with World Map and Tactical Map and basic city info
-Create simple I/O for player input
